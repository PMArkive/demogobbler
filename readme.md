# demogobbler
demogobbler is a library for parsing demo files written in C. Almost nothing is done so far and remains to be seen how far I'm gonna take this project.

# Building
1. Install meson
2. `meson setup build`
3. `meson compile -C build`  

Linux and friends:
Install meson via your package manager.

Windows:
Meson can be installed through pip via `pip install meson`. After this add the installation path of meson to your PATH. Steps 2 and 3 should be run through the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt (Tools -> Command Line -> Developer Command Prompt).
