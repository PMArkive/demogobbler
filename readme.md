# demogobbler
demogobbler is a library for parsing demo files written in C. Almost nothing is done so far and remains to be seen how far I'm gonna take this project.

# Building
1. Install meson
2. `meson setup build`
3. `meson compile -C build`  

Windows:
On Windows you should run meson through the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt (Tools -> Command Line -> Developer Command Prompt). Meson can be installed through pip
